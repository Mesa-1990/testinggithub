            <!-- <p>Our Mission</h1> -->
            <p><h1>Our Mission</h1> For a long period after its creation in 1978 with a mandate to support innovation in the agriculture sector, Peru’s National Institute for Agricultural Innovation (INIA) made limited progress. Constraints included stagnant budgets, inadequate infrastructure, constant reorganization, and a high rate of staff turnover. Operating in an uncertain and constantly shifting policy environment, INIA faced difficulties establishing coherent priorities and implementing effective programs. INIA’s chronically weak performance led to waning political support that was soon reflected in a lack of financial backing: between 2000 and 2010, Peru’s public spending on agricultural research and development averaged less than 1 % of agricultural GDP, extremely low by global standards. The resulting lack of innovation contributed to a productivity slowdown and kept the agriculture sector from achieving the high rate of sustained growth needed to improve food security and reduce poverty in rural areas.</p>

A demand-driven competitive grants mechanism supported 541 subprojects, generating innovations that have been adopted by nearly 32,000 farmers, boosting their incomes by an average of 34 %. In addition, more than 75,000 training days were provided to researchers and
